# Kulorised
*Originally a Minestom game jam project.*  

Kulorised is a teamwork based game where two players are played in a map where they must work together to help each other get to the end. Each player is given two different coloured blocks which when held, will change what blocks are solid for their teammate. For example if Player 1 holds their red block, then all the red blocks on the ground will become solid for Player 2.
